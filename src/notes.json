    "note": "Please **note** that the clustering dataset is built with multi input address clustering to avoid false clustering results due to coinjoins (see TITANIUM glossary http://titanium-project.eu/glossary/#coinjoin), we exclude coinjoins prior to clustering. This does not eliminate the risk of false results, since coinjoin detection is also heuristic in nature, but it should decrease the potential for wrong cluster merges."
